The login page MUST BE RUN on a seperate GitBash/Terminal from the LorryDoc app.
In other words, you need two terminals running at the same time, one for LorryDoc, and one for the login page.
Execute command for the login page is "node server.js", and it runs on port 3001 while LorryDoc runs on port 3000.
